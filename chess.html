                        </div>
                        <p>During my sophomore year of high school, I learned a lot about programming in C and I decided that I wanted to undertake a large scale project. The project I ultimately decided to pursue was a fully functional and competitive Chess Engine. I had a lot of experience with competitive chess and I saw this project as a way to combine both of my interests into a project.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Design Process</h3>
                        <p>Initially, I drew inspiration from existing chess engines and how they were structured. Fundamentally, a chess engine consists of 3 major functions: a way to represent a chess board, a way to generate all legal moves and  a way to evaluate each given board position.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to represent the board, I decided to use a bitboard. A bitboard is a 64 bit data structure that also contains information about the type of the piece and the color of the piece. This structure allows for a board to represent any given chess position without any loss of detail relative to reality.  Choosing a bitboard within this aspect of the engine compromised between code simplicity and performance. This meant that the bitboard was relatively simple to program at the slight expense of overall performance.
                        </p>
                        <p>The next aspect of the engine was a search algorithm. For my engine, I chose to go with an alpha-beta search. An alpha-beta search is an improved variant of the widely known minimax algorithm. Fundamentally, the search works by finding a set of moves that results in the best numerical position value for the player (alpha) and the lowest numerical position value (beta) for the opponent. Since each subsequent move search increases the number of possible board positions exponentially, it is highly important to optimize the search algorithm. I was able to do this through the implementation of aspiration windows and various other pruning methods. These methods serve to reduce the number of moves that are needed to be traversed by removing the “useless” moves. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, the last major aspect of the engine is an evaluation function. The evaluation function takes a board position as input and outputs a numerical value indicative of the relative desirability of that position. This function is used in conjunction with alpha-beta search to find the best given move within the moveset. For my engine, I chose to use hard encoded position values. This works by prioritizing positive piece trades as well as certain positions within the board. For example, my engine would tend to value moves that establish control over the center square of the board. Although such an evaluation function is easy to implement, this comes at the expense of flexibility. Most higher level engines tend to use machine learning evaluation functions which are able to exploit the flexibility of non-hard encoded positional evaluation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Currently I am working on implementing multithreaded search into this engine. Given that the search algorithm is hardware limited, the implementation of multithreaded search would have massive performance gains. This difficulty in this implementation lies in the complexity of multithreading within traditional C. Multithreading in C requires deep knowledge of spin locks, interrupts and other low level functions of threads. In addition, Alpha-Beta search is designed in single threaded applications and thus must be altered to function with multithreaded search. I am currently considering the implementation of monte-carlo search tree which would be compatible with multithreaded search.
