                        <p>With the ever-increasing need for computational performance, many have looked to an increase in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) frequency as a method to gain additional computing power. This is seen in the wide variety of commercial DRAM frequencies ranging from 1600 megahertz to upward of 5100 MHz. An increase in DRAM frequency results in greater memory bandwidth that a central processing unit can utilize for computation. A somewhat recent publication has revealed that single-bit errors within RAM are much more common than previously thought. We hypothesized that the increased single-bit error rate of DRAM was correlated with frequency. We also wanted to investigate if external factors such as temperature or time affect error rate. In order to test our hypothesis, we utilized single-bit error detection software along with Double Data Rate Four DRAM (DDR4) at three specified frequencies. Through our testing we discovered a strong and positive relationship between frequency and error rate, indicating a correlational relationship between frequency and errors. However, we have yet to determine whether this relationship stems from the physical impact of frequency on DRAM or the other interrelated components such as the Integrated Memory Controller. Further research on Integrated Memory Controller design and frequency response would shed light on the greater complex interactions within CPU - memory frequency relationship.

                        <p>During my junior year of high school, I decided that I wanted to pursue scientific research regarding computer engineering. A major inspiration for this research was my interest in computer system overclocking, specifically that of DRAM overclocking. A major aspect of DRAM overclocking was increasing the memory frequency beyond that of the standard XMP profile. This, however, was often at the expense of system stability. In my research, I wanted to scientifically explore the factors within computer systems that result in memory errors and system instability. To do so, I worked under the mentorship of my engineering teacher to design, conduct, and author a research paper.

                        <p>This paper was then submitted to the Journal of Emerging Investigators and was approved for publication. The paper is currently undergoing editing for grammar and clarity. This paper should be fully published within the upcoming weeks.
